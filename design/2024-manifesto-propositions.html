                <p>
                  To maximise progress towards our mission through systemic
                  learning and collaboration, both within IIED and beyond, we
                  have identified a set of six interconnected propositions (or
                  goals). These six propositions define the systems in which
                  IIED will tackle the big blockers and the broader triple
                  crises and help to focus our work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are the result of an intensive conversation between
                  members of IIED and our partners and are deliberately designed
                  to be overlapping, making the most of IIED’s signature
                  capabilities, networks and track record. It also means that
                  the full portfolio of interventions and the dynamic teams
                  assembled to advance them, can connect in deliberately planned
                  and unexpected ways, and offer a rich landscape for generating
                  insights and learning.

                    People move for a variety of reasons. As of 2020, there were
                    over 280 million international voluntary migrants. An
                    additional 120 million people were forcibly displaced
                    internally and internationally by the end of 2023. The
                    majority end up in urban centres that need to be equipped to
                    absorb additional populations safely and protect human
                    rights in the context of a changing climate.

                    68% of the world’s population are expected to live in cities
                    by 2050. Cities consume 78% of the world’s energy and
                    account for 60% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Now
                    1.1 billion people live in informal settlements and many
                    hundreds of millions are exposed to climate impacts despite
                    only having marginal emissions themselves. Cities can be
                    hotspots for innovative forms of governance, technologies
                    and inclusion.

                    Warming is still projected to be &gt;2.5⁰C by 2100, with
                    1.5⁰C limit temporarily breached. Climate change increasing
                    some extremes and with slower onset impacts, causing loss
                    and damage. Adaptation actions not achieving positive
                    results at scale, coupled with only modest resources
                    reaching local level.

                    One million species are now threatened with extinction. The
                    Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) sets a target of 30% of
                    land/seas being protected by 2030, along with a strong call
                    to have this stewarded by Indigenous Peoples and local
                    communities (including recognising the importance of
                    Indigenous and traditional territories). The GBF also
                    highlights the importance of the use of biodiversity as well
                    as its protection.
